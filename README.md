# ininaERP

Welcome to **ininaERP**, a next-generation CRM/ERP platform designed for seamless integration and enhanced automation. Leveraging the power of open-source, it includes automated installation, maintenance, and development of Odoo community modules.

As a "soft-fork" of the Odoo Community Edition (OCE), ininaERP emphasizes collaboration and aims to contribute enhancements back to the community. It is built on a robust foundation of production-ready modules supported by the Odoo Community Association (OCA) and a vibrant ecosystem of specialized companies. This ensures digital sovereignty while integrating pre-trained Generative Transformers (GPT) for advanced data management and automation.
